<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Fixation and Stabilization System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nonresorbable</li><li>Resorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cranial Fixation and Stabilization System market is divided into two primary types: nonresorbable and resorbable materials. Nonresorbable systems are made of durable materials that remain in the body permanently, providing long-term stability for cranial surgeries. In contrast, resorbable systems are designed to gradually dissolve over time, eliminating the need for a second surgery to remove implants. Each type serves specific surgical needs, balancing between lasting support and the patient's healing process.</p></p>
